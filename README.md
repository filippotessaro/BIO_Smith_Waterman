# BIO_Smith_Waterman
This is an implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm

## Recoursive and normal version
The recursive version computes the algorithm in a recursive manner while the other one generates the score matrix and, 
once found the best score, does a traceback through the pointer matrix.

To run the program type the following script line
```
python3 tessaro-smith-waterman.py
```
